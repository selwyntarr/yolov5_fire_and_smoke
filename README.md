# Fire & Smoke Detection with YOLOv5 

This project utilizes the Ultralytics YOLOv5 object detection model to accurately identify and detect fire and smoke in real-time video feeds or images. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled instances of fire and smoke, enabling it to recognize these hazards quickly and reliably. By leveraging YOLOv5's efficiency and precision, the system aims to enhance early fire detection and improve safety measures in various environments.
